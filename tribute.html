                <div class="intro-para">Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (15 October 1931 â€“ 27 July
                    2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist who served as the 11th
                    president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in
                    Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace
                    engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and
                    science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and
                    Development Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research
                    Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian
                    space programme and military missile development efforts.[1] He thus
                    came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the
                    development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle
                    technology.[2][3][4] He also played a pivotal organisational,
                    technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in
                    1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.</div>
